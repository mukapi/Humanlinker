(e.g., right of access, right to erasure, etc.). </li> </ul> <ul> <li> “Client Personal Data”: means any data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person transmitted to the Processor and processed by it on behalf of the Client under the Service and whose detailed list is set out in the annex. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>“Party(ies)”: jointly refers to the Client and the Processor.</li> </ul> <ul> <li> “GDPR”: means Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data also titled “General Data Protection Regulation”. </li> </ul> <ul> <li> “Applicable Data Protection Law”: jointly refers to French Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on information technology, files and civil liberties and the GDPR. </li> </ul> <ul> <li> “Reversibility”: means the operation enabling the transfer and integration, in a usable and recognized format, of the Client’s Personal Data from the Processor’s Service to an equivalent service offered by another provider. </li> </ul> <ul> <li> “SaaS Service”: means software hosted by the Processor and usable simultaneously by an unlimited number of clients. </li> </ul> <ul> <li> “Subprocessor”: means processors engaged by the Processor to process the Client’s Personal Data exclusively in the context of the Service. </li> </ul> <ul> <li> “End Users”: means the persons whose Personal Data are processed by the Processor on behalf of the Client. </li> </ul> <h2>3.

Roles of the Parties and scope</h2> <p> Within the framework of the Addendum, the Client acts as controller and Humanlinker acts as processor within the meaning of Article 28 of the GDPR. </p> <p> Under no circumstances shall the Parties be considered joint controllers under the Service. However, the Parties agree that in case of error or change in their qualification, the Parties shall meet as soon as possible to amend the Addendum and take all measures related to such situation to comply with the requirements of the Applicable Data Protection Law. </p> <p> The Addendum exclusively governs processing of the Client’s Personal Data carried out within the Service as a processor within the meaning of Article 28 of the GDPR, excluding processing carried out as a controller by Humanlinker which is governed by the Agreement. </p> <p> For certain features, in particular those related to data enrichment from public sources, behavioral analysis, prospect recommendation or content generation using AI models, Humanlinker acts as a separate controller, in accordance with its Privacy Policy available at https://www.humanlinker.com/fr/privacy-policy. </p> <p> These processing activities are carried out independently, for the purposes and according to the legal bases described in said Privacy Policy, without the Client having to provide instructions. </p> <h2>5.

The Processor’s liability shall not be incurred where, despite the Processor’s notice concerning the illegality of the instruction, the Client maintains and applies such instruction through the Service. </p> <p> The Processor undertakes to comply with the GDPR and, in particular, to keep a record of processing activities specific to the Service and to develop its Service in compliance with “Privacy by design” and “Privacy by default”. </p> <p> The Processor undertakes never to transfer the Client’s Personal Data for reasons other than the provision of the Service and undertakes never to use the Client’s Personal Data for its own interest as a controller. </p> <p> The Processor declares that all internal or external staff required to process the Client’s Personal Data are bound by one or more binding legal acts and are regularly trained and made aware. </p> <p> The Processor undertakes to ensure the security of the Client’s Personal Data and to implement all necessary technical and organizational measures for its Service, the details of which are presented in the annex to the Addendum. </p> <p> However, the Processor is never responsible for the Client’s failures regarding the Applicable Data Protection Law when it uses the Service as controller. </p> <h2>6. Assistance with DPIAs</h2> <p> DPIAs must be carried out by the Client, in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR. Nevertheless, the Processor undertakes to provide, at the Client’s written request, all necessary and required information so that the Client can carry out a DPIA. </p> <p> The Processor is not required to carry out DPIAs in place of and on behalf of the Client.

Any request to ensure such management will be refused. Requests sent to the Processor in its capacity as controller are handled exclusively by the Processor and are not forwarded to the Client. </p> <h2>8.

The Client understands and agrees that the 72-hour period applicable to it only starts from the moment it becomes aware of the personal data breach and, as such, the 48 business hours meet GDPR requirements. </p> <p> The Processor is not authorized to handle notifications of personal data breaches to the Supervisory Authority nor to inform, on behalf of the Client, End Users. Any such request from the Client will be refused. </p> <h2>10. Subprocessors</h2> <p> The Client grants the Processor general authorization to engage Subprocessors provided it is informed of any change to these Subprocessors as soon as possible to allow the Client to raise objections. The Client understands and agrees that specific authorization, for a SaaS tool, is not applicable and could lead to a blockage of the Service. </p> <p> In the absence of objections raised by the Client within eight (8) days from notification, the new Subprocessor is definitively engaged without the Client being able to object, claim damages or request termination of the Agreement. The notification will include the Subprocessor’s identity, location and the nature of the processing concerned. If the objection raised within the deadline is considered admissible by the Processor, the latter may offer the Client one of the following solutions: (i) withdrawal of the Subprocessor, (ii) implementation of additional measures to ensure the security of the Client’s Personal Data, (iii) termination of the Service without the Client being able to claim damages. </p> <p> To be considered admissible by the Processor, objections must be objective and serious and duly evidenced. The Parties agree that the following situations shall, by default, be considered admissible: (i) the proposed Subprocessor is a direct competitor of the Client, (ii) the Subprocessor is in litigation with the Client, (iii) the Subprocessor has been sanctioned by a Supervisory Authority within the 12 months preceding its engagement, and (iv) the Subprocessor does not comply, where applicable, with the applicable rules on transfers outside the European Union. </p> <p> The Processor undertakes to engage only those Subprocessors that, after verification, provide the necessary and sufficient guarantees to ensure the security and confidentiality of the Client’s Personal Data. The relationship between the Processor and any Subprocessor must be governed by an agreement containing obligations similar to this Addendum. </p> <p> The Processor remains responsible, within the liability limits provided in the Agreement, for GDPR breaches that its Subprocessors may commit under the Service. </p> <h2>11. Hosting and transfers outside the European Union</h2> <h3>(a) Data hosting</h3> <p> The Processor undertakes to use best efforts to host the Client’s Personal Data exclusively within a Member State of the European Union. The Client authorizes the Processor to choose the EU Member State of its choice. In the event the Client’s Personal Data are hosted in a country outside the European Union, the Processor undertakes to obtain the Client’s prior authorization and to implement all mechanisms required to govern such transfer, such as entering into Standard Contractual Clauses and, where appropriate, implementing additional technical measures to enhance the security of the Client’s Personal Data. </p> <h3>(b) Data transfers</h3> <p> The Client grants the Processor general authorization to carry out transfers outside the European Union if, cumulatively, (i) transfers are made exclusively to Subprocessors that comply with the GDPR and (ii) transfers are made exclusively to a country benefiting from an adequacy decision or are governed by appropriate safeguards such as, in particular, Standard Contractual Clauses. If these conditions are not met, transfers outside the European Union are only authorized with the Client’s prior consent. Additional technical security measures enhancing the protection of the Client’s Personal Data must be implemented where Personal Data are transferred to a non-democratic country. </p> <h2>12. Retention periods and fate of the Client’s Personal Data</h2> <p> The Processor undertakes to retain the Client’s Personal Data only for the duration of the use of the Service, in accordance with the detailed instructions in the annex, and to delete them at the end of the Agreement. The Processor shall certify, upon written request, the deletion of the Personal Data and all existing copies. </p> <p> The Client is informed that it must retrieve its Personal Data before the end of the Addendum. Failing this, the Client can no longer recover its Personal Data; deletion of personal data is irreversible and final. The Processor cannot be held responsible for any loss of Personal Data after their deletion, the Client bearing full responsibility. The Client agrees that total, irreversible anonymization of the Client’s Personal Data may be used as a means of deletion and that the Processor may retain anonymized data for Service improvement, as accepted by Supervisory Authorities. Data are anonymized irreversibly according to prevailing standards. In case of doubt regarding anonymization, Humanlinker undertakes to process such data in accordance with the GDPR. </p> <p> The Processor informs the Client that the restitution of Personal Data provided for in the GDPR does not constitute data Reversibility to a new processor and that any request to this effect will always be refused by the Processor. </p> <h2>13. Audits</h2> <p> The Client has the right to carry out an audit in the form of a written questionnaire once a year to verify compliance with this Addendum. The questionnaire has the force of an honor commitment binding the Processor. The questionnaire may be provided to the Processor in any form; the Processor undertakes to respond as soon as possible from its receipt. </p> <p> The Client also has the right, once a year and at its expense, to conduct an on-site audit, where applicable, at the Processor’s premises in the event of a data breach due to a proven and demonstrated failure by the Processor having caused duly justified damage to the Client. An on-site audit may be conducted either by the Client or by an independent third party appointed by the Client and must be notified in writing to the Processor at least thirty (30) days before the audit is carried out. The Processor has the right to refuse the choice of the independent third party if the latter is (i) a direct or indirect competitor of the Processor, (ii) in a conflict of interest with the Processor (e.g., advisor to a competitor of the Processor), or (iii) in pre-litigation or litigation with the Processor. In such case, the Client undertakes to choose a new independent third party to carry out the audit. The Processor may refuse access to certain areas for confidentiality or security reasons. In such case, the Processor shall perform the audit in those areas and share the results with the Client. </p> <p> In the event of a discrepancy identified during the audit, the Processor undertakes to implement, without delay and at its expense, the necessary measures to comply with this Addendum. Discrepancies may only concern the Applicable Data Protection Law for the Client’s Personal Data and shall not concern procedures or internal measures implemented by the Client on a specific basis. Discrepancies must be duly evidenced, justified, and documented. </p> <p> If the Processor contests the discrepancies identified, the Processor may, at its choice and with the Client’s prior written acceptance, propose to (i) meet to find an amicable solution and compromise, (ii) refer the matter to the Supervisory Authority to obtain arbitration on the dispute, and (iii) appoint an independent expert to arbitrate the dispute. </p> <h2>14. Cooperation with authorities</h2> <p> The Processor undertakes to cooperate with the CNIL, the competent Supervisory Authority, in the event of an inspection regarding processing carried out under the Service and undertakes to notify the Client as soon as possible in the event of requests concerning its Personal Data made by the Supervisory Authority or by an administrative, judicial, or police authority. </p> <h2>15. Contact</h2> <p> The Client and the Processor each designate a representative responsible for this Addendum who will be the recipient of the various notifications and communications to take place under the Addendum. </p> <p> The Processor informs the Client that it has appointed Dipeeo SAS as Data Protection Officer, who can be contacted as follows: </p> <ul> <li>Email address: dpo@humanlinker.com</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Postal address: Dipeeo SAS, 95 avenue du Président Wilson, 93100 Montreuil, France</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Telephone number: +33 1 59 06 81 85</li> </ul> <h2>16.
